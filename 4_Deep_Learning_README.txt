This is a final project for the "Deep Learning" section of "Machine Learning Engineer" Nanodegree by Udacity. The task for this project is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that processes an image of a dog and provides an estimate of the dog's breed. The skills I learned from this project include:

- Understanding the architecture of CNN models, including how different design of layers and kernel size can change the result
- Understanding the challenges involved in putting together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in data processing pipeline
