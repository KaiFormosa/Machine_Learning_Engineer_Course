This is a final project for the "Unsupervised Learning" section of "Machine Learning Engineer" Nanodegree course by Udacity. In this project, unsupervised learning techniques are applied on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. At first, a small subset of the sample is selected to determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. After scaling each product category and removal of unwanted outliers, PCA transformations to the data is applied and clustering algorithm implemented to segment the transformed customer data. The skills I learned include:

- Applying preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection
- Interpreting data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA
- Analyzing PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space
- Clustering data find hidden patterns in a dataset
- Assessing information provided by cluster data
