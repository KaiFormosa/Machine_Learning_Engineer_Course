This is my capstone project for “Machine Learning Engineer” Nanodegree course by Udacity. The task is to solve a problem of my choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques I have learned throughout the course. 

The guideline below is followed throughout this project:

1. Define the problem 
2. Investigate potential solutions and performance metrics
3. Analyze the problem through visualization and data exploration
4. Select the algorithms and metrics based on the analysis and implement them
5. Collect the results of algorithm models and validate the values
6. Construct conclusions 

The question I wanted to answer in this project is what factors predict strong retention and graduation rate in U.S. higher education institutions. A research finding shows that Americans with a bachelor’s degree can earn a million dollars more throughout their entire career in comparison to those without. However, what makes one school better in retention and graduation rate than others? I analyzed the data collected by the U.S. government on 6,806 U.S. higher education institution and applied algorithms to identify a few strong predictors out of 190 factors.

The skills I learned from this project include:

- Research and investigate a real-world problem
- Apply specific machine learning algorithms and techniques 
- Analyze and visualize the data and results for validity
- Document and write a report of the work
