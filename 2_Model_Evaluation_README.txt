This is a final project for the "Model Evaluation and Validation" section of "Machine Learning Engineer" Nanodegree course by Udacity. My task for the project is to build an optimal model based on statistical analysis and several techniques for training, testing, evaluating and optimizing models are used. Skills I learned from this project include:

- Using NumPy to explore data and investigate the latent features of a dataset
- Training and testing models
- Analyzing learning performance and identify potential problems, such as errors due to bias or variance
- Applying techniques to improve the model, such as cross-validation and grid search

About the Data

The dataset for this project is a modified version of the famous Boston Housing dataset found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features.
