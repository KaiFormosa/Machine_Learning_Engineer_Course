This is a final project for the "Supervised Learning" section of "Machine Learning Engineer" Nanodegree by Udacity. The tasks for this project are analyzing a census dataset and identify possible donors with supervised learning algorithm for a charity organization. The skills I learned from this project include:

- Identifying when preprocessing is needed and how to apply it
- Establishing a benchmark for a solution to the problem
- Understanding what each of several supervised learning algorithms and their arguments accomplish
- Evaluating how each algorithm performs as the best solution model to the problem

About the Data

The dataset for this project is a modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. (https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The original dataset is hosted on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income.
